        <h1>My Biography</h1>
        <article class="biography_article">
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>I was born on February 18, 1999 in the beautiful country of Mexico. I lived in Mexico up until I was 3 years
                old. My parents wanted our family to have a better life so they decided that moving to the USA would benefit
                us all. We've been in Charlotte ever since and I've grown to love the city.</p>
            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>I like to think that I have many hobbies. I love to draw even though I'm not that good at it. I love to watch
                soccer. That's much different from actually playing the sport. I enjoy playing video games in my free time
                although I haven't had much of it lately.</p>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>I am currently in the Road2Hire Tech Cohort. Road2Hire is a nonprofit organization that focuses on sales, leadership,
                and technology. It promotes economic mobility in young adults aged 18-25. I started the program on the 18th
                of June of 2018. I've been loving it so far and I plan on making the most out of this opportunity. My goal
                is to find a career in a field that I love. I'm taking my first steps to achieving this goal.</p>
